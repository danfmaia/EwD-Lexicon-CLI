To develop the "interactive transcription" feature for the PI Text Processor as a part of the "transcribe" subparser, we will follow a step-by-step approach. This approach ensures the feature is developed methodically and efficiently. Here's the plan for its development:

### Plan for Developing Interactive Transcription

#### Step 1: Define the Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Modify `main.py` to include the `--interactive` option under the "transcribe" subparser.

#### Step 2: Implement User Interaction for Dictionary Update
- In `main.py`, when the `--interactive` flag is used, prompt the user to decide if they want to update the dictionary.
- If the user chooses to update, call the dictionary update function from `dict_gen.py`.

#### Step 3: Implement PI Level/Mode Selection
- After the dictionary update step (or if skipped), prompt the user to select the PI level or mode (L1, L2, L3, FM).

#### Step 4: Text Processing Setup
- Read the input text and split it into sentences.
- For each sentence, split it into words while keeping punctuation and special characters intact.

#### Step 5: Interactive Word-by-Word Transcription
- For each sentence:
   - Show 1 to 7 words at a time, marking the "selected" word.
   - Allow navigation through the sentence (move the "selected" word left or right).
   - For the selected word, perform a case-insensitive lookup in the PI dictionary.

#### Step 6: Handle Word Entry Matches
- When a match is found in the dictionary:
   - Display the PI equivalent(s) based on the selected PI level or mode.
   - Allow the user to confirm the replacement or skip to the next word.

#### Step 7: Compile and Save the Transcribed Text
- After processing each sentence, compile the transcribed text.
- Save the transcribed text to a dynamically named file or as specified by the user.

#### Step 8: Testing and Refinement
- Test the interactive transcription feature with various inputs to ensure robustness.
- Refine the implementation based on feedback and testing results.

### Execution of the Plan

We'll execute each step, starting with defining the CLI for the interactive option. Let's begin with Step 1:

#### Step 1: Define the CLI for Interactive Option

Update `main.py` to include the `--interactive` option:

```python
def main():
    # Existing setup...
    transcribe_parser.add_argument('--interactive', action='store_true', help='Enable interactive transcription mode')
    # Rest of the function...

# Proceed with the existing implementation...
```

This change in `main.py` sets up the structure to handle the interactive transcription mode. We'll continue with the next steps, implementing each part of the feature one by one, ensuring each step is functional before moving to the next.
