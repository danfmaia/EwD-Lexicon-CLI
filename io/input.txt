Subject: Collaborative Potential: PI Project and "English Really Needs Accent Marks" Video

Hi Name Explain Team,

My name is Danilo Maia, but you may call me Dan. I recently caught your video "English Really Needs Accent Marks" on YouTube. Great stuff – it's a perspective that resonates deeply with my work on the PI Project, which I've been developing for some time now. It's all about innovating English pronunciation and listening didactics, something I think aligns well with the themes you've been exploring.

Just to give you a bit of context, my brainchild on the PI Project is the ‘PI Scaffold-Spelling System’, which I used to refer to simply as ‘PI’, and now i'm also referring to as ‘English with Diacritics’ (EwD) on the context of my Master's research plan. While it may look like a straight answer to you video, it's essential to clarify that my approach is NOT a spelling reform proposal. Its main goal instead is to support learners in understanding the associations between regular English spellings and their respective pronunciations, making it especially useful for EFL/ESL learners.

Interestingly, I had started conceptualizing this even before stumbling upon your video. It's been a journey of exploring phonology from a fresh angle, and I'm currently looking to delve deeper into its academic potential through a Master's program.

This journey of exploring phonology from a fresh angle has been intriguing, and I'm currently looking to delve deeper into its academic potential through a Master's program. In this light, I see an opportunity here for a interesting exchange of ideas. Maybe a conversation, a guest piece, or any format that you think could work well on your platform. I'm open to suggestions and would love to contribute something unique to your audience.

Let's keep it simple and see where this goes. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, I'm all ears for your thoughts on how we could make it work.

Looking forward to the possibility of collaborating.

Best regards,
