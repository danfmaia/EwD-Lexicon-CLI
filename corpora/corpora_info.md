## Pre-Reading Note

Access corpora_info_in_ewd.md to read this article in EwD L0.

## 1. The Corpus Row

### 1.1. Row Format

SE | L0 ⦚ L1 < L2 > L3 ¦ Full

### 1.2. Explaining the Columns: EwD Variants

**SE** (or **sE** when uncapitalized) stands for _standard English_. This is our term for words or texts written in the regular English spelling, without diacritics or any other sort of pronunciation guidance. This article is written in SE.

**L0**, **L1**, **L2**, **L3** and **Full** are the five main _variants_ of **English with Diacritics (EwD)**, the four "L"s also meaning the didactic levels. Below is the explanation for each of them:

- [TODO: complete this explanation] The L0 (Level 0) is EwD's **absolute-beginner** level. {Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.} _When omitted on a corpus row, the L0 word is equal to the L1 word._

- Level 1 (L1) — The L1 (Level 1) is EwD's **beginner** level. It includes only the indications that are essential for newcomers. It avoids the specifics of unstressed syllables and some nuances¹ of stressed syllables. _When omitted on a corpus row, the L1 word is equal to the sE word._

- L2 — TheLevel 2) is EwD's **intermediate** level. It provides a more detailed guidance, utilizing a decent amount of applicable indications to guide learners towards a holistic understanding of English pronunciation. In this level, learners will acknowledge the patterns of unstressed syllables and explore nuances¹ of stressed syllables not covered in the previous levels. _When omitted on a corpus row, the L2 word is equal to the L1 word._

- And the L3 (Level 3) is the **advanced** level of EwD. It is also known as the _minimal_ variant. After exposure to extensive indications of the previous level, this level retains only the most essential ones. Thus, learners will understand which of EwD's indications are actually unnecessary (or not very necessary) as they gradually grasp the patterns of spoken English. _When omitted on a corpus row, the L3 word is equal to the L1 word._

- And, finally, the Full variant is the **most phonetic** presentation of EwD. It is not a level, but a variant meant to be used on _dictionary entries_ or the like. As such, it goes very specific and ships all applicable marks, with the exception of a few beginner level (L0 or L1) ones, as well as some marks deemed very unnecessary in any EwD variant. _When omitted on a corpus row, the Full variant word is equal to the **L2** word._

## 2. The Accept-or-Except Strategy (AES)

The Accept-or-Except Strategy (AES) in EwD is a key mechanism that balances the integrity of sE spelling with the need for phonetic clarity. This strategy primarily focuses on *retaining standard spellings*², and on applying _diacritical marks_ only when necessary to assist in pronunciation — this is the **Accept side**.

[TODO: increment this paragraph, briefly explain the word distinction method used]
Conversely, when standard spellings obscure the correct pronunciation, and diacritics would complicate them more than clarify, EwD shifts to the **Except side**, adopting so-called _fallback graphemes_ that more accurately reflect spoken English.

This approach eases the learning process and facilitates the transition from EwD-assisted reading to independent reading. By preserving standard spellings as much as possible, EwD helps learners recognize and understand the spelling-to-speech patterns of English, thereby gradually building their confidence and proficiency in pronouncing English words without diacritical assistance.

### 2.1. AES Sides

Below is the more detailed explanation for the two sides of the just-explained strategy:

- **Accept side** — The collective of words left untouched and words that are treated only with diacritic(s). About **97%** of the 1000 most common English words are on this side. We may also refer to this as the "A" side.

- **Except side** — The collective of words for which diacritics are deemed not enough or not suitable to indicate pronunciation. The words from this side are known as _exceptions_. About **3%** of the 1000 most common English words are on this side. We may also refer to this as the "E" side.

### 2.2. The "Not Disclosed / Disclosed" Approach

[TODO: continue this explanation] For exceptions, the EwD material employs a "not disclosed / disclosed" approach in order to hide or clarify their pronunciation according to the necessity. The "not disclosed" form is a given exception with the irregular grapheme preserved, while the "disclosed" form is the same word with such grapheme replaced by its corresponding _fallback grapheme_. {Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.}

### 3.2.1. AES Groups

[TODO: add explanation]

- [A]: Accepted — Words on the **Accept side**; the collective of words from [Au] and [Ad] subgroups. The words on this group are known as _accepted words_.

  - [Au]: Accepted, untouched — [A] words that _don't_ receive diacritics in any level; the so-called _untouched words_.

  - [Awd]: Accepted, with diacritics — [A] words that receive *diacritic(s) in at least one level*².

  - [Awdⁿ]: Accepted, with diacritics, n — [Ad] words that receive _diacritic(s) only at given level(s)_. "n" corresponds to the level number(s).

- [E]: Exceptions — Words on the **Except side**; the collective of words from [Eap] and [Esp] subgroups.

  - [Eap]: Exception, all pronunciations — [E] words whose _all_ used pronunciations require fallback graphemes to be clarified. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

  - [Eapⁿ]: Exception, all pronunciations, n — [E] that are treated with fallback graphemes only at given levels. "n" corresponds to the level number(s). In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

  - [Esp]: Exception, some pronunciations — [E] words whose _some_ of its used pronunciations (but now all of them) require fallback graphemes to be clarified. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.
  
### 3.2.2. Didactics

[TODO: add explanation]
  
- [D]: Didactic — Highly didactic single words. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

- [DC]: Didactic Combo — Highly didactic word combos. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

### 3.2.3. SE Spelling

[TODO: add explanation]

- AS: American spelling

- BS: British spelling

- FE: Word with _false etymology_

Notes:

1. nuance … ¹(GB/GA) ²(CP/LCP)

2. In fact, EwD strives to keep as meny{many} words as possible on this side, with about 97% of the 1000 (one thousand) most frequent English words falling under the **Accepted** category in EwD v2.
