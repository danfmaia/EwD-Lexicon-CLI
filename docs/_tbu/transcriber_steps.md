Now read the whole code and write me its steps, numbering. Consider I'm a business client, not a programmer.

Certainly! Here's a high-level overview of how the PI Transcriber script works, broken down into clear, numbered steps for a business-oriented understanding:

1. **Initialization and Welcome Message**: The script starts by greeting the user and explaining its primary function, which is to perform text replacements based on specific rules.

2. **Loading the Input File**: The script attempts to open and read a text file provided by the user. This file contains the text that needs to be processed.

3. **User Confirmation for Preliminary Replacements**: The script asks the user if they want to proceed with preliminary text replacements. These are basic, predefined text changes, such as turning "the" into "theÌ¬".

4. **Performing Preliminary Replacements**: If the user agrees, the script carries out these initial text replacements.

5. **Saving Intermediate Results**: After completing the preliminary replacements, the script saves this partially modified text to a temporary file. This step is crucial for keeping track of changes and ensuring data isn't lost.

6. **Choosing a PI Variation**: The script prompts the user to choose a specific PI variation. PI variations are different sets of rules for text transformation (like L1, L2, L3, and Full Mode).

7. **Processing Text Based on PI Variation**: Once the user selects a PI variation, the script applies a more complex set of text transformations based on that variation. It modifies the words in the text according to the rules of the chosen variation.

8. **Saving Updated Results to Temporary File**: The script updates the temporary file with the text transformed according to the chosen PI variation.

9. **Final Confirmation for Saving Results**: The user is asked whether they want to save the final result of the text processing. This is an important step for user control over the output.

10. **Saving Final Output**: If the user confirms, the script saves the final, transformed text to a new file. This file represents the end product of the script's processing.

11. **Error Handling**: Throughout these steps, the script includes checks for potential issues, such as the input file not being found or errors during file writing. This ensures reliability and user awareness of any problems.

The script aims to be user-friendly by guiding the user through each step with clear instructions and options, making it easy to use even for those without a programming background.
