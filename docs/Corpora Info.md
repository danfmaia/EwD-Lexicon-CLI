## Pre-Reading Note

## 1. The Corpus Row

### 1.1. Row Format

> SE | L0 ⦚ L1 < L2 > L3 ¦ Full

### 1.2. Explaining the Columns: SE and the EwD Variants

**SE** stands for _standard English_. This is our term for words or texts written in the regular English spelling, without diacritics or any other sort of pronunciation guidance. This article is written in SE.

**L0**, **L1**, **L2**, **L3** and **Full** are the five main _variants_ of **English with Diacritics (EwD)**, the four "L"s also meaning the didactic levels. Below is the explanation for each of them:

- [TODO: complete this explanation] Level 0 (L0) — EwD's **absolute-beginner** level. {Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.} _When omitted on a corpus row, the L0 word is equal to the L1 word._

- Level 1 (L1) — EwD's **beginner** level. It includes only the indications that are essential for newcomers. It avoids the specifics of unstressed syllables and some nuances of stressed syllables. _When omitted on a corpus row, the L1 word is equal to the SE word._

- Level 2 (L2) — EwD's **intermediate** level. It provides a more detailed guidance, utilizing a decent amount of applicable indications to guide learners towards a holistic understanding of English pronunciation. In this level, learners will acknowledge the patterns of unstressed syllables and explore nuances of stressed syllables not covered in the previous levels. _When omitted on a corpus row, the L2 word is equal to the L1 word._

- Level 3 (L3) — EwD's **advanced** level. It is also referred to as the _Minimal_ variant. After exposure to extensive indications of the previous level, this level retains only the most essential ones. Thus, learners will understand which of EwD's indications are actually unnecessary (or not very necessary) as they gradually grasp the patterns of spoken English. _When omitted on a corpus row, the L3 word is equal to the L1 word._

- Full variant — The **most transparent** presentation of EwD. It is not a level, but a variant meant to be used on _dictionary entries_ or the like. As such, it goes very specific and ships all applicable marks, with the exception of a few beginner level (L0 or L1) ones, as well as some marks deemed very unnecessary in any EwD variant. _When omitted on a corpus row, the Full variant word is equal to the **L2** word._

It's important to mention that learners are _not_ meant to move from variant L3 to Full. On the contrary, the next step after L3 is the transition to reading SE texts without phonetic assistance, that is, gradually exiting EwD.

## 2. The Accept-or-Except Strategy (AES)

The Accept-or-Except Strategy (AES) in EwD is a key mechanism that balances the integrity of SE spelling with the need for phonetic clarity. This strategy primarily focuses on _retaining standard spellings_, and on applying _diacritical marks_ only when necessary to assist in pronunciation — this is the **Accept side**¹.

[TODO: increment this paragraph, briefly explain the word distinction method used]
Conversely, when standard spellings obscure the correct pronunciation, and diacritics would complicate things more than clarify, EwD shifts to the **Except side**, adopting so-called _fallback graphemes_ that more accurately reflect spoken English.

[TODO: improve or change this paragraph]
This approach eases the learning process and facilitates the transition from reading with diacritical assistance to reading independently. By preserving standard spellings as much as possible, EwD helps learners recognize and understand the spelling-to-speech patterns of English, thereby gradually building their confidence and proficiency in pronouncing English words without phonetic assistance.

### 2.1. AES Sides

Below is a brief explanation for the two sides of the Accept-or-Except Strategy:

- **Accept side** — The collective of words left intact (without diacritics) AND words fully compatible with EwD's diacritical system\*. The words from this side are referred to as _accepted words_. About **98%** of the 1000 most frequent English words are on this side. We may also call this the "A" side.

- **Except side** — The collective of words for which diacritics are deemed not enough or not suitable to indicate pronunciation. The words from this side are referred to as _exceptions_. Only about **2%** of the 1000 most frequent English words are on this side. We may also call this the "E" side.

### 2.2. The "Not Disclosed / Disclosed" Approach

[TODO: continue this explanation] For exceptions, the EwD material employs a "not disclosed / disclosed" approach in order to hide or clarify their pronunciation according to the necessity. The "not disclosed" form is a given exception with all letters preserved, while the "disclosed" form is the same word with the difficult grapheme replaced by its corresponding _fallback grapheme_. {Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.}

[TODO: add explanation]

### 3.2.1. AES Groups

[TODO: add explanation and examples]

- [A]: Accepted — The group comprising words on the **Accept side**¹. It is made up of subgroups [Ain] and [Awd]. The words on this group are referred to as _accepted words_.

  - [Ain]: Accepted, intact — [A] words that _don't_ receive diacritics in any level.

  - [Awd]: Accepted, with diacritics — [A] words that receive _diacritic(s) in at least one level_.

    - [Awdⁿ]: Accepted, with diacritics, n — [Awd] words that receive _diacritic(s) only at given level(s)_. The "n" corresponds to the level number(s).

- [E]: Exception — The group comprising words on the **Except side**. It is made up of subgroups [Eap] and [Esp]. The words on this group are referred to as _exceptions_.

  - [Eap]: Exception, all pronunciations — [E] words whose _all_ used pronunciations require fallback graphemes to be clarified. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

    - [Eapⁿ]: Exception, all pronunciations, n — [Eap] words that are treated with fallback graphemes only at given levels. The "n" corresponds to the level number(s). In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

  - [Esp]: Exception, some pronunciations — [E] words whose _some_ of its used pronunciations (but not all of them) require fallback graphemes to be clarified. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

### 3.2.2. Didactics Tags

[TODO: add explanation and, maybe, examples]

- \[DS]: Didactic Single — A group comprising highly didactic single words. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

- \[DC]: Didactic Combo — A group comprising highly didactic word combos. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

### 3.2.3. SE Spelling Tags

[TODO: add explanation and examples]

- AS: American spelling

- BS: British spelling

- FE: Word with _false etymology_

## Appendix

Notes:

1. EwD strives to keep as many words as possible on the Accept side, with 97,9% of the 1000 most frequent English words falling under this side (in EwD v2.7).

- The diacritical system behind EwD is named English Diacritical System (EDS). We don't refer to it routinely because it's a more technical stuff.
