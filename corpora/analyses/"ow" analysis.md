I grouped the words under the two groups:

```
46:  how |
96:  down |
99:  now |
384: vowel | ** < vowe̬l >
408: power | ** < powe͜r >
409: town |
596: cow |
613: flower | ** < flowe͜r >
754: brown |
831: crowd |
862: allow_vb | ** < a̬llow >

89:  know | knōw
120: show | shōw
137: low | lōw
205: own | ōwn
212: grow | grōw
390: slow | slōw
505: snow | snōw
723: row | rōw
743: blow | blōw
762: flow | flōw
906: throw | t‍̤hrōw
```

Analyse again to estimate which PG is more frequent.

Given the updated grouping and considering the order of words by their frequency (from most to less frequent), we now have a clearer picture to estimate which phonographeme (PG) is more frequent for the "ow" grapheme in English:

**PG ow⟨ow⟩ for /aʊ/**:

1. how
2. down
3. now
4. vowel
5. power
6. town
7. cow
8. flower
9. brown
10. crowd
11. allow

**PG ow⟨long-o⟩ for /oʊ/**:

1. know
2. show
3. low
4. own
5. grow
6. slow
7. snow
8. row
9. blow
10. flow
11. throw

Both phonographemes have an equal number of words listed (11 each). However, to estimate which PG is more frequent, we consider the position of each word in the corpus. The words associated with the /aʊ/ sound include "how", "down", and "now", which are among the first 100 words, indicating a higher frequency of occurrence in English. Additionally, "power" and "flower" are also relatively high in the list, further supporting the frequency of /aʊ/.

Contrastingly, for the /oʊ/ sound, while "know" and "show" also appear relatively early in the list, the rest of the words are more spread out, with some appearing later in the corpus.

Based on the ordering and assuming the corpus accurately reflects the frequency of word usage in English, we can infer that **PG ow⟨ow⟩ for /aʊ/** might be slightly more frequent due to the higher placement of its words within the corpus. This inference suggests that in practical usage, the /aʊ/ sound represented by "ow" could be encountered slightly more often than the /oʊ/ sound, considering the most frequent words in English usage.

This analysis, however, is qualitative and based on the relative positions of words in a corpus ordered by frequency. For a quantitative estimate, actual frequency counts for each word would be necessary.
