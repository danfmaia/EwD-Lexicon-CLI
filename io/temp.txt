[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a̬ lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a̬ stairway to̬ Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the̬ stores are all closed
With a̬ word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a̬ stairway to̬ Heaven
There's a̬ sign on the̬ wall, but she wants to̬ be sure
'Cause yöu know sometimes words have two meanings
In a̬ tree by the̬ brook, there's a̬ songbird who sings
Sometimes all o̬f our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a̬ feeling I get when I look to̬ the̬ West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings o̬f smoke through the̬ trees
And the̬ voices o̬f those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the̬ tune
Then the̬ piper will lead us to̬ reason
And a̬ new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the̬ forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If there's a̬ bustle in yöur hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a̬ spring clean for the̬ May queen
Yes, there are two paths yöu can go by, but in the̬ long run
There's still time to̬ change the̬ road yöu're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Yöur head is humming, and it won't go, in case yöu don't know
The̬ piper's calling yöu to̬ join him
Dear lady, can yöu hear the̬ wind blow? And did yöu know
Yöur stairway lies on the̬ whispering wind?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the̬ road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a̬ lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to̬ show
How everything still turns to̬ gold
And if yöu listen very hard
The̬ tune will come to̬ yöu at last
When all are one, and one is all
To̬ be a̬ rock and not to̬ roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a̬ stairway to̬ Heaven
