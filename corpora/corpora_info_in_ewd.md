## Pre-Reading Note

For the sake of dĕmonstra̖tion, this̩ file is written in EwD v2.8 L1+. Acce̗ss “EwD Corpora Info.pdf” to read this̩ article in standard Ėnglish.

List of exce̖ptions occu͡rred in this̩ article:

## 1. The Corpus Rōw

### 1.1. Rōw Forma̗t

> SE | L0 ⦚ L1 < L2 > L3 ¦ Füll

### 1.2. Expla̖ining the Cŏlumns: SE and thē EwD Variants

**SE** stands for _standard Ėnglish_. This̩ is our te͡rm for wo͡rds or texts written in the rĕgular Ėnglish spelling, without diacrĭtics or äny ôther sort of pronu̗ncia̖tion guidance.

**L0**, **L1**, **L2**, **L3** and **Füll** are the five main _variants_ of **Ėnglish with Diacrĭtics (EwD)**, the fŏur "L"s also meaning the dida̖ctic levels. Belōw is thē explana̖tion for each of them:

- [TODO: comple̖te this̩ explana̖tion] [Written in L0] Lĕvel 0 (L0) — EwD's **absolute-beg̍ĭnner** lĕvel. {Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.} _When omĭtted on a corpus rōw, thē L0 wo͡rd is equal to thē L1 wo͡rd._

- [Written in L1] Level 1 (L1) — EwD's **begĭnner** lĕvel. It inclu̖des only thē indica̖tions that a̍re esse̖ntial fo͜r newcomers. It avoids the̬ speci̖fics o̬f{o̬‹v›} un꞉stresse̊d syllables and sôme nū(a̍/a̖̍)nces o̬f stresse̊d syllables. _When omi̖tted on a̬ corpus rōw, thē L1 wo͡rd is equal to̬ thē SE wo͡rd._

- [Written in L2] Lĕvel 2 (L2) — EwD's **inte͜rme̖dia̬te** lĕvel. It pro̬vi̖des a̬ more d(e/ē)taile̊d guida̬nce, uti̬lizing a̬ dece̬nt a̬mount o̬f{o̬‹v›} applica̬b͢le indica̖tio̬ns to̬ guide le͡arne͜rs to̬waᷱrds a̬ ho̱li̖stic unde͜rsta̖nding o̬f Ėnglish pro̬nu̗ncia̖tio̬n. In this̩ lĕve̬l, le͡arne͜rs will a̬cknŏẘlẹdge the̬ patte͜rns o̬f un꞉stresse̊d sylla̬b͢les and ẹxplo̖re nū(a̍/a̖̍)nces o̬f stresse̊d sylla̬bles not côve͜re̊d in the̬ previo͢us lĕve̬ls. _When o̬mi̖ttẹd on a̬ corpu̬s rōw, thē L2 wo͡rd is equa̬l to̬ thē L1 wo͡rd._

- [Written in L3] Lĕvel 3 (L3) — EwD's **adva̖nced** lĕvel. It is also refe̖rred to as the _Mĭnimal_ variant. After expo̖sure to exte̖nsi̯ve indications of the previous̩ lĕvel, this̩ lĕvel retains ōnly the mōst esse̖ntial ones*. Thus̩, le͡arners will understa̖nd which of EwD's indications a̍re actually un꞉nĕcessary (or not vĕry nĕcessary) as they grădually grasp the patterns of spoken Ėnglish. _When omi̖tted on a corpus̩ rōw, thē L3 wo͡rd is equal to the L1 wo͡rd._

  \* one | ‹wun›

- [Writte̬n in Füll varia̬nt] Füll varia̬nt — The̬ **mōst tra̗nspa̖re̬nt** pr(ĕ/ē)se̬nta̖tio̬n o̬f{o̬‹v›} EwD. It is not a̬ lĕve̬l, but a̬ varia̬nt mĕant to̬ be use̊d on _dictio̬n(a̗/a̬)ry entries_ or the̬ like. As such, it goe̊s vĕry sp(e̬/ẹ)cĭfic and ships aᷱll applica̬b͢le marks, with thē ẹxce̖ptio̬n o̬f a̬ few bẹg̍ĭnne͜r lĕve̬l (L0 or L1) ones{‹wuns›}, as well as sôme marks deeme̊d vĕry un꞉nĕce̬ss(a̗/a̬)ry in äny EwD varia̬nt. _When o̬mi̖ttẹd on a̬ corpu̬s̩ rōw, the̬ Füll varia̬nt wo͡rd is equa̬l to̬ thē **L2** wo͡rd._

[Switching back to̤ L1+ for the remainder of the dŏcument.] It's impo̖rtant to mention that le͡arners a̍re _not_ mĕant to möve fro̬m variant L3 to̬ Full. On the contrary, the next step after L3 is the transition to reading SE texts without phonĕtic assi̖stance, that is, grădually exiting EwD.

## 2. Thē Acce̖pt-or-E̗xce̖pt Strătegy (AES)

Thē Acce̖pt-or-E̗xce̖pt Strătegy (AES) in EwD is a kēy mĕc‍̤hani̗s͢m that bălances thē intĕgrity of SE spelling with the need for phonĕtic clarity. This̩ strătegy pri̱m(a̖/a)rily focus̩es̩ on _retaining standard spellings_, and on applȳing _diacrĭtical marks_ ōnly when nĕcessary to̤ assi̖st in pronu̗ncia̖tion — this̩ is thē **Acce̖pt side**¹.

[TODO: increme̖nt this̩ paragra̗ph, briefly explain the wo͡rd disti̖nction method use̊d]
Conve͡rse̊ly, when standard spellings obscu̖re the corre̖ct pronu̗ncia̖tion, and diacrĭtics would{w‹o͝o›d} complicate more than clarify̱, EwD shifts to thē **E̗xce̖pt side**, ado̖pting so-calle̊d _fallback graphemes_ that more accurạte̊ly refle̖ct spoken Ėnglish.

[TODO: impröve or chānge this̩ paragra̗ph]
This̩ approach eases the le͡arning pr(ō/ō)cess and facĭlitates the transi̖tion from reading with diacrĭtical assi̖stance to reading indepe̖ndently. By prese̖rving standard spellings as much as possib͢le, EwD helps le͡arners rĕcognize and understa̖nd the spelling-to-speech patterns of Ėnglish, thĕre꞉by grădually bůilding their confidence and profĭciency in pronouncing E̍nglish wo͡rds without phonĕtic assi̖stance.

### 2.1. AES Sides

Belōw is a brief explana̖tion for the tẘo sides of thē Acce̖pt-or-E̗xce̖pt Strătegy:

- **Acce̖pt side** — The colle̖cti̯ve of wo͡rds left inta̖ct (without diacrĭtics) ĂND wo͡rds fülly compătible with EwD's diacrĭtical system*. The wo͡rds from this̩ side a̍re refe͡rre̊d tö as _acce̖pted wo͡rds_. About **97%**{nine̊ty-sĕven perce̖nt} of thē 1000 (‹one› t‍̤housand) mōst frequent Ėnglish wo͡rds a̍re on this̩ side. We may also call this̩ thē "A" side.

- **E̗xce̖pt side** — The collĕcti̯ve o̬f wo͡rds for which diacrĭtics a̍re deeme̊d not eno᷍u‹gh›{eno᷍u‹ff›} or not sui̊table to̤ indicate pronu̗ncia̖tion. The wo͡rds from this̩ side a̍re refe͡rred to̤ as _e̗xce̖ptions_. About **3%** of thē 1000 most frequent English words are on this side. We may also call this thē "E" side.

### 2.2. The "Not Disclosed / Disclosed" Approach

[TODO: continue this explanation] For exceptions, thē EwD material employs a "not disclosed / disclosed" approach in order to hide or clarify their pronunciation according to the necessity. The "not disclosed" form is a given exception with all letters preserved, while the "disclosed" form is the same word with the difficult grapheme replaced by its corresponding _fallback grapheme_. {Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.}

### 3.2.1. AES Groups

[TODO: add explanation and examples]

- [A]: Accepted — The group comprising words on thē **Accept side**¹. It is made up of subgroups [Au] and [Awd]. The words on this group are referred to̤ as _accepted words_.

  - [Ain]: Accepted, intact — [A] words that _don't_ receive diacritics in any level.

  - [Awd]: Accepted, with diacritics — [A] words that receive _diacritic(s) in at least one level_.

    - [Awdⁿ]: Accepted, with diacritics, n — [Awd] words that receive _diacritic(s) only at given level(s)_. Thē "n" corresponds to the level number(s).

- [E]: Exception — The group comprising words on thē **Except side**. It is made up of subgroups [Eap] and [Esp]. The words on this group are referred tö as _exceptions_.

  - [Eap]: Exception, all pronunciations — [E] words whose _all_ used pronunciations require fallback graphemes to be clarified. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

    - [Eapⁿ]: Exception, all pronunciations, n — [Eap] that are treated with fallback graphemes only at given levels. Thē "n" corresponds to the level number(s). In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

  - [Esp]: Exception, some pronunciations — [E] words whose _some_ of its used pronunciations (but now all of them) require fallback graphemes to be clarified. In the corpora these words are always tagged accordingly.

- BS: British spelling

- FE: Word with _false etymology_

## Appendix

Notes:

1. EwD strives to keep as many words as possible on thē Accept side, with about 97% of thē 1000 (one thousand) most frequent English words falling under this side (up to̤ EwD v2.7).

* The diacritical system behind EwD is named English Diacritical System (EDS). We don't use this name routinely because it's a more systems-related stuff.
