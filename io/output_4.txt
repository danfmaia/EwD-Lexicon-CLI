Subject: Collaborative Potential: PI Prŏject and "English Really Needs Accent Marks" Video

Hi Name Explain Team,

My name is Danilo Maia, but yöu may call me Dan.

I recently caught yöur video "English Really Needs Accent Marks" on YouTube.

Grëat stuff – it's a̬ perspective that resonates deeply with my wo͡rk on the̬ PI Prŏject, which I've be͝en developing for sôme time now.

It's all abo̖ut innovating English pronu̗ncia̖tion and listening didactics, something I t̤hink aligns well with the̬ themes yöu've be͝en exploring.

Just to̬ ġĭve yöu a̬ bit ‹o̬v› context, my brainchild on the̬ PI Prŏject is the̬ ‘PI Scaffold-Spelling System’, which I used to̬ refer to̬ simply as ‘PI’, and now i'm also referring to̬ as ‘English with Di̱acrĭtics’ (EwD) on the̬ context ‹o̬v› my Master's r(ė/ē)ṣe͡arch plan.

While it may lo͝ok like a̬ straight ansẘer to̬ yöu video, it's essential to̬ clarify that my approach is NOT a̬ spelling reform proposal.

Its main goal instead is to̬ suppōrt learners in understanding the̬ associations betwe̖en regular English spellings and their respective pronu̗ncia̖tions, making it espĕcially useful for EFL/ESL learners.

Interestingly, I had started conceptualizing thiṣ even befo̖re stumbling upon yöur video.

It's be͝en a̬ jo͡urney ‹o̬v› exploring phonology fro̬m a̬ fresh angle, and I'm currently looking to̬ delve deeper into its ăcadĕ̖mic potential t̤hröugh a̬ Master's program.

Thiṣ jo͡urney ‹o̬v› exploring phonology fro̬m a̬ fresh angle has be͝en intriguing, and I'm currently looking to̬ delve deeper into its ăcadĕ̖mic potential t̤hröugh a̬ Master's program.

In thiṣ light, I see a̬n opportunity here for a̬ interesting exchange ‹o̬v› idēa̬s.

Maybe a̬ conversation, a̬ guest pı͞ece, or a̤ny format that yöu t̤hink c‹o͝o›d wo͡rk well on yöur platform.

I'm open to̬ suggestions and w‹o͝o›d lôve to̬ contribute something u̱nïque to̬ yöur audience.

Let's keep it simple and see whĕre thiṣ goes.

If thiṣ sounds like something yöu'd be interested in, I'm all ears for yöur t̤h‹aw›ts on how we c‹o͝o›d make it wo͡rk.

Looking forward to̬ the̬ possibility ‹o̬v› collaborating.

Best regards,
