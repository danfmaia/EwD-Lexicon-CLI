Just to̬ ġĭve yöu a̬ bit ‹o̬v› context, my brainchild on the̬ PI Prŏject is the̬ ‘PI Scaffold-Spelling System’, which I used to̬ refer to̬ simply as ‘PI’, and recently i've be͝en also referring to̬ as ‘**English with Di̱acrĭtics**’ (**EwD**) on the̬ context ‹o̬v› my ăcadĕ̖mic r(ė/ē)ṣe͡arch plan.

While it may seem like a̬ dire̖ct ansẘer to̬ the̬ question raised by the̬ video, it's important to̬ note that I had started working on EwD mônths befo̖re stumbling upon yöur content.

I t̤hink thiṣ is a̬ nătural coincidence, since, in fact, di̱acrĭtics in English hăve always be͝en a̬ necessity, just lacking for individuals to̬ see and defend it.

Besides that, it's essential to̬ clarify that EwD is not a̬ spelling reform proposal.

Instead, its main goal is to̬ suppōrt learners in understanding the̬ associations betwe̖en regular English spellings and their respective pronu̗ncia̖tions, which c‹o͝o›d make it espĕcially useful in EFL/ESL scenarios.
