# Unveiling Bergmann's Rule in Ectotherms: Pattern and Processes associated with ge̱ogra̖phic gradient in bŏdy size in North Atlantic Reef Fish

## Topics

### Bŏdy Size:

- The̬ stŭdy ‹o̬v› ge̱ogra̖phical varia̖tion in bi̱olŏgical traits acro̖ss species has b(e͝en/‹en›) a̬ fundame̖ntal aspe̗ct ‹o̬v› nătural sciˌences since the̬ 19th century

- Bŏdy size significantly influences vario͜uṣ processes at individual, population, and species lĕvels, shaping ecological dynamics, niche adaptation, and broader evolutionary trends -- fitness

- Organisms exhibit profound ecological and evolutionary shifts owing to̬ chānges in bŏdy size, impacting their ecological roles, interaction dynamics, and even extinction probabilities

- Morphological varia̖tion of(t̊/t)en aligns with chānges in bŏdy size, suggesting a̬ more frequent occurrence ‹o̬v› ecological shifts due to̬ chānges in size rather than shape (Alencar et al, 2022).

- The̬ complexity ‹o̬v› bŏdy size, influenced by multiple selective pressures and dimensions, poses challenges in deciphering gĕneral patterns ‹o̬v› size evolution (Clarke 2021; Alencar et al, 2022).

**Bergmann's Rule**

- Bergmann's rule, proposed by Carl Bergmann in 1847, sug͝ge̖sts that the̬ ge̱ogra̖phic distribution ‹o̬v› ănimal species is influenced by bŏdy size alone: smaller species prefer warmer climates, while larger ‹wun›s requi̖re colder climates (Vinarski, 2014).

- Thiṣ hypothesis predicts a̬ relationship betwe̖en bŏdy size and climate: larger sizes in colder regions, which aligns with the̬ macroecological concept known as Bergmann's rule (Pincheira‐Donoso, 2010; Watt et al.

2010).

- Bergmann's rule has vario͜uṣ definitions, of(t̊/t)en involving local latitude and/or temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture factors (Vinarski, 2014).

- Clinal phenotypic selection driven by ge̱ogra̖phical varia̖tion in temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)tures leads to̬ large-scale gradients ‹o̬v› bŏdy mass varia̖tion within ănimal clades, supporting Bergmann's rule (Pincheira‐Donoso, 2010).

- **Arguments on Bergmann's Rule Validity**

- Arguments exist bōth supporting and refuting Bergmann's rule: sôme sug͝ge̖st it's a̬n artifact or a̬ byproduct ‹o̬v› ôther adaptive processes (Vinarski, 2014).

- Different hypotheses, adaptive and non-adaptive, attempt to̬ explain the̬ observed ge̱ogra̖phic varia̖tion in bŏdy size, of(t̊/t)en linked to̬ environmental factors like temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture (Vinarski, 2014).

- **Adaptive Hypotheses (nătural selection):**

- Temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture-Dependent Adaptations: larger organisms, adapted for cold environments, hăve a̬ lower su͡rface-to̬-volume ratio, which aids in ĕnergy/heat conservation in lōw temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)tures

- Selective Pressures in Different Environments: in warmer environments, ôther selective pressures might impact fitness, reducing the̬ predictability ‹o̬v› temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture-based effe̖cts on bŏdy size.

- Fine Adjustment ‹o̬v› Growth Rates and development duration as mechanisms that lead to̬ the̬ optimal bŏdy size for partĭcular condi̖tions.

- **Non-Adaptive Hypotheses**:

- Ge̱ogra̖phic varia̖tion is determined by the̬ dire̖ct modifying impact ‹o̬v› environmental factors (for exa̖mple, temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture) on ănimal bŏdy size.

**Arguments aġ(a̤in/a̖in)st Bergmann's Rule Validity**

- Taxonomic Artifact in Bergmann's Rule: due to̬ insufficient taxonomic knowledge rather than being indicative ‹o̬v› true̊ adaptations to̬ tempeadaptirature.

- Statistical Correlations with Bŏdy Size: Sôme non-adaptive hypotheses sug͝ge̖st that Bergmann's clines äre not due to̬ bŏdy size it꞉self but rather to̬ ôther traits that display statistically significant correlations with bŏdy size.

**Bergmann's Rule for Ectotherms**

- Endotherms, such as bı͡rds and mammals, of(t̊/t)en shōw evidence supporting Bergmann's rule with bŏdy size - Distinct physiological differences betwe̖en endotherms and ectotherms hint at specific factors influencing the̬ formation ‹o̬v› Bergmann's clines, suggesting a̬ need for more targeted investigations (Vinarski, 2014).

- Historical analyses by Ray and Lindsey supporting Bergmann's rule in ectotherms but with caution aġ(a̤in/a̖in)st generalizations

- Even closely related species may display different varia̖tion trends.

- Larger bŏdy size might be disadvantageous for ectotherms in colder environments due to̬ the̬ inefficiency ‹o̬v› heat retention.

- Factors such as delayed sexual maturity at lower temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)tures or growth advantages in cold-reared gröups complicate the̬ straightforward application ‹o̬v› the̬ rule to̬ ectotherms.

- Even if temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture dete͡rmi̯nes the̬ final bŏdy size in a̬ lot ‹o̬v› caṣes, temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture alone is not determinative since its dire̖ct impact is countered by ôther factors in nătural condi̖tions

- Probably, thĕre is a̬n absence ‹o̬v› a̬ single universal explanation for Bergmann's varia̖tion in ectotherms, with multiple factors interacting at different latitudes.

- Thĕre is a̬n alternative hypotheses, such as the̬ suggestion that ectotherms might follow Rensch's rule instead ‹o̬v› Bergmann's rule : the̬ maximal size ‹o̬v› organisms is recorded in localities with the̬ optimal temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture for them.

Thuṣ, such organisms reach their maximal size not in the̬ "north" or "south" but in the̬ locality that may be in a̤ny part ‹o̬v› their distribution rānge.

(Vinarski, 2014)

**Bergmann Rule in Marine Fishes**

- Vario͜uṣ studies suppōrt a̬ positive correlation betwe̖en fish size and latitude (Lindsey,1966).

Although studies on freshwater and marine fish sug͝ge̖st variability in the̬ application ‹o̬v› Bergmann's rule (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Wimpenny (1941) observed larger fish sizes in tropical regions for marine fish.

- Lukin (1940) noted larger fish sizes in cold w(aᷱ/aᪿ)ter.

- Elasmobranchs and teleosts collectively showed a̬ trend ‹o̬v› more small species in the̬ tropics, - espĕcially prominent in deep-sea fish (Lindsey,1966).

- Using mixed model with taxonomic hīera̗rc̣hy Bergmann's rule is supported by a̬ latitudinal pattern in shallow w(aᷱ/aᪿ)ter Actinopterygii bŏdy size, with larger species found at higher latitudes (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- A̬ latitudinal trend in fish size holds for marine fish communities in the̬ North Atlantic, southern Indian, and Pacific ‹ōshən›s (Fisher et al., 2010).

**Possible Mechanisms Underlying Bergmann's Rule**

- Rules äre predictions abo̖ut ecological phenomena under specific condi̖tions.

- Mechanisms driving patterns in ‹wun› system may apply acro̖ss different systems.

- Larger bŏdy size at high latitudes may resu̖lt fro̬m reduced tension in biotic relationships (predation and competition) \-- bŏdy size ‹o̬v› predators is controlled by their prey size and the̬ presence ‹o̬v› competitors.

- McNab (1971) (Nonadaptive Hypothesis) links predator-prey dynamics to̬ explain bŏdy size in weasels.

Assuming predator size correlates with prey size, larger predators can consume fo͞od acro̖ss a̬ larger size rānge, and mean fo͞od size available to̬ weasels decreases with increasing latitude.

- **Productivity pulse theory (**Rosenzweig,1968): primary productivity may be correlated with bŏdy size.

The̬ hypothesis predicts a̬ reversal ‹o̬v› bŏdy size with latitude, because the̬ duration ‹o̬v› the̬ pulse is short at bōth lōw (tropical) and high latitudes (arctic)

- **Seasonality hypothesis** (Boyce, 1979; adaptive) sug͝ge̖sts larger bŏdy size is a̬n evolutionary strategy in resource-limited populations -- evaluated with climatic seasonality.

The̬ theory conne̖cts bŏdy size varia̖tion to̬ the̬ **seasonal availability and predictability ‹o̬v› resources** in different environments.

Here, bŏdy size in homeotherms is constrained by the̬ time growing individuals hăve unhindered access to̬ high-quality fo͞od - in environments whĕre resources äre seasonally abundant and unpredictable, larger bŏdy size in homeotherms.

During perio̬ds ‹o̬v› **resource abundance, larger ănimals can maximize their growth**.

**Mechanisms Underlying Bergmann's Rule in Marine Fishes**

- Temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture and Time to̬ Sexual Maturity: Ectothermic species growing at lower temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)tures matu̖re more slowly and attain larger sizes (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Resource Availability: Larger bŏdy size corresponds to̬ increased fo͞od resource needs, supporting a̬ positive relationship with resource availability (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Osmoregulation: Larger species äre expected to̬ cope better with higher salinity lĕvels due to̬ increased osmoregulation capacity (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Anthropogenic factors, including climate chānge and fishing, can lead to̬ bŏdy size reductions in marine fishes (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Size varia̖tion is influenced by Sea Su͡rface Temp(er/e̊r)(å/a)ture (SST) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP), supporting time to̬ sexual maturity and resource availability hypotheses (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Unexplored hypotheses inclu̖de abiotic factors, biotic interactions, historical factors, and anthropogenic factors.

- Scholander (1956) and Ashton et al.

(2000) stress the̬ need for deeper r(ė/ē)ṣe͡arch into physiological interpretations.

**Objectives**

- In thiṣ wo͡rk we aim to̬ unveil abiotic mechanisms driving patterns ‹o̬v› bŏdy size variance in Elasmobranchii and Actinopterygii, inhabiting reef environments at North Atlantic ‹ōshən› considering taxonomic diversity
