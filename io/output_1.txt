Subject: Collaborative Potential: PI Prŏject {and, un: a̬nd} "English Really Needs Accent Marks" Video

Hi Name Explain Team,

My name is Danilo Maia, but yöu may call me Dan.

I recently caught {y(öur/ŏur/ōur), un: yo͜ur} video "English Really Needs Accent Marks" on YouTube.

Grëat stuff – it's {a̬, str: ā} perspective that resonates deeply with my wo͡rk on th(e̬/ē) PI Prŏject, which I've b(e͝en/‹en›) developing {fo͜r, str: fŏr} sôme time now.

It's all abo̖ut innovating English pronu̗ncia̖tion {and, un: a̬nd} listening didactics, something I t̤hink aligns well with th(e̬/ē) themes yöu've b(e͝en/‹en›) exploring.

Just t(o̬/o̤) ġĭve yöu {a̬, str: ā} bit {‹o̬v›, str: ‹ov›} context, my brainchild on th(e̬/ē) PI Prŏject is th(e̬/ē) ‘PI Scaffold-Spelling System’, which I used t(o̬/o̤) refer t(o̬/o̤) simply {a̬, str: ā}s ‘PI’, {and, un: a̬nd} now i'm also referring t(o̬/o̤) {a̬, str: ā}s ‘English with Di̱acrĭtics’ (EwD) on th(e̬/ē) context {‹o̬v›, str: ‹ov›} my Master's r(ė/ē)ṣe͡arch plan.

While it may lo͝ok like {a̬, str: ā} straight ansẘer t(o̬/o̤) yöu video, it's essential t(o̬/o̤) clarify that my approach is NOT {a̬, str: ā} spelling reform proposal.

Its main goal instead is t(o̬/o̤) suppōrt learners in understanding th(e̬/ē) associations betwe̖en regular English spellings {and, un: a̬nd} their respective pronu̗ncia̖tions, making it espĕcially useful {fo͜r, str: fŏr} EFL/ESL learners.

Interestingly, I had started conceptualizing thiṣ even befo̖re stumbling upon {y(öur/ŏur/ōur), un: yo͜ur} video.

It's b(e͝en/‹en›) {a̬, str: ā} jo͡urney {‹o̬v›, str: ‹ov›} exploring phonology {from, un: fro̬m} {a̬, str: ā} fresh angle, {and, un: a̬nd} I'm currently looking t(o̬/o̤) delve deeper into its ăcadĕ̖mic potential t̤hröugh {a̬, str: ā} Master's program.

Thiṣ jo͡urney {‹o̬v›, str: ‹ov›} exploring phonology {from, un: fro̬m} {a̬, str: ā} fresh angle has b(e͝en/‹en›) intriguing, {and, un: a̬nd} I'm currently looking t(o̬/o̤) delve deeper into its ăcadĕ̖mic potential t̤hröugh {a̬, str: ā} Master's program.

In thiṣ light, I see {a̬n, str: ăn} opportunity here {fo͜r, str: fŏr} {a̬, str: ā} interesting exchange {‹o̬v›, str: ‹ov›} idēa̬s.

Maybe {a̬, str: ā} conversation, {a̬, str: ā} guest pı͞ece, or a̤ny format that yöu t̤hink c‹o͝o›d wo͡rk well on {y(öur/ŏur/ōur), un: yo͜ur} platform.

I'm open t(o̬/o̤) suggestions {and, un: a̬nd} w‹o͝o›d lôve t(o̬/o̤) contribute something u̱nïque t(o̬/o̤) {y(öur/ŏur/ōur), un: yo͜ur} audience.

Let's keep it simple {and, un: a̬nd} see whĕre thiṣ goes.

If thiṣ sounds like something yöu'd be interested in, I'm all ears {fo͜r, str: fŏr} {y(öur/ŏur/ōur), un: yo͜ur} t̤h‹aw›ts on how we c‹o͝o›d make it wo͡rk.

Looking forward t(o̬/o̤) th(e̬/ē) possibility {‹o̬v›, str: ‹ov›} collaborating.
