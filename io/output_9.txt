[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Thĕre's a̬ lady ẘhö's sure all that glitters is gōld
And she's buying a̬ stairway to̬ Heaven
When she g̍ets thĕre she knōws, if the̬ stores a̍re all closed
With a̬ wo͡rd she can g̍et what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a̬ stairway to̬ Heaven
Thĕre's a̬ sīg̊n on the̬ wall, but she wants to̬ be sure
'Cause yöu knōw sometimes wo͡rds hăve tẘö meanings
In a̬ tree by the̬ brook, thĕre's a̬ songbird ẘhö sings
Sometimes all o̬f {**, un: ‹ar›} t̤h‹aw›ts a̍re misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wônder
Ooh, makes me wônder

[Verse 2]
Thĕre's a̬ feeling I g̍et when I lo͝ok to̬ the̬ West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my t̤h‹aw›ts I hăve seen rings o̬f smoke t̤hröugh the̬ trees
And the̬ voices o̬f those ẘhö stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wônder
Ooh, really makes me wônder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that so͞on if we all call the̬ tune
Then the̬ piper will lead us̩ to̬ reason
And a̬ new day will dawn for those ẘhö stand long
And the̬ fŏrests will ec̣ho with laughter

[Chorus]
Ōh-ōh-ōh-ōh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If thĕre's a̬ bustle in yöur hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a̬ spring clean for the̬ May queen
Yes̩, thĕre a̍re tẘö paths yöu can go by, but in the̬ long run
Thĕre's still time to̬ chānge the̬ road yöu're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wônder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Yöur hĕad is humming, and it wôn't go, in cas̩e yöu don't knōw
The̬ piper's calling yöu to̬ join him
Dear lady, can yöu hear the̬ w(i/ī)nd blōw? And did yöu knōw
Yöur stairway lies on the̬ whispering w(i/ī)nd?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we w(i/ī)nd on down the̬ road
{**, un: ‹ar›} shadows taller than {**, un: ‹ar›} soul
Thĕre wal̊ks a̬ lady we all knōw
W̊hö shines white light and wants to̬ shōw
How ĕve̊ry·t̤hing still tu͡rns to̬ gōld
And if yöu list̊en vĕry hard
The̬ tune will côme to̬ yöu at last
When all a̍re ‹wun›, and ‹wun› is all
To̬ be a̬ rock and not to̬ rōld

[Outro]
And she's buying a̬ stairway to̬ Heaven
